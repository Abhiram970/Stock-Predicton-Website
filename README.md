# Stock Prediction Website

In this project, we will examine the stock price of a company as reported from real historic data from thousands of investments. Some features along with additional data for identification of data entries will be supplied as a Comma Separated File (.csv), that may be opened and analysed in Excel, Spreadsheet or python. This project then focuses on developing a model that predicts the target return rate of investments. The primary objective of this project would be to deploy a website that helps predicting the investment returns based on some features given as an input. 
The website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery for the front end. The backend utilises Django, python along with PostgreSQL database.
The website features a login page that allows an existing user to login and a register page that allows a new user to register and gain access to the website services. The data is stored in the database along with the predictions for future reference. These predictions are then displayed on the webpage in a user-friendly interface.
